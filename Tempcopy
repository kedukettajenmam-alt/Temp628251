Disabling Managed Package Runtime switches OmniStudio execution from managed package runtime to standard (non-namespaced) runtime.

There is no data impact, as all data is already stored in Standard Objects.

Existing compiled OmniScripts and FlexCards were built using managed runtime and must be recompiled after the change.

Design-time metadata remains unchanged.

Custom LWCs are not impacted, as they already use standard omnistudio/ imports
