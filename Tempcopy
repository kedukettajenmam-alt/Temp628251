Hi Nishika,

I am currently working on the OmniStudio runtime migration as part of story BUK-5321.

As part of this change, we are updating the Permission Set Groups for all onboarding user personas by adding the following permission sets:

OmniStudio_Standard_Designer_User

OmniStudio_Additional_Permission

Could you please confirm if adding these permission sets would require any IAM changes or approvals from your end?

Please let me know if you need more details.

Thanks and regards,
